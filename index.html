        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm <strong>Esihle Mkhusane</strong>,all the way from South Africa I am an educator, self-taught web developer, and lifelong learner with a passion for technology and problem-solving.</p>
    
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I hold a <strong>Bachelor of Education in Foundation Phase Teaching</strong>, which has allowed me to inspire and shape young minds. Currently, I am expanding my expertise in technology by pursuing a <strong>Diploma in Software Engineering at WeThinkCode_</strong>, a leading coding academy that focuses on real-world programming skills.</p>
    
        <h3>My Tech Journey & Interests</h3>
        <p>My love for technology began with curiosity. I started teaching myself <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> and quickly became fascinated with web development. This journey has led me to explore problem-solving through code and find ways to integrate technology into education.</p>
        <p>As an educator, I believe in the power of accessible tech education. I've introduced my students to <strong>coding and robotics</strong> using free online resources, proving that anyone can learn to code regardless of their background.</p>
    
        <p>Beyond web development, I have a deep interest in <strong>cybersecurity engineering</strong>. This passion was sparked when my cousin fell victim to online scammers. Seeing how it affected her made me realize the importance of digital security, and I donâ€™t want anyone else to go through the same pain. 
        My goal is to protect big companies and individuals from cyber threats, ensuring a safer digital world.</p>
