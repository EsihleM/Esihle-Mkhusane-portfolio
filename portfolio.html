        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm <strong>Esihle Mkhusane</strong> a passionate educator, self-taught web developer, and tech enthusiast who loves bringing learning to life. I hold a degree in <strong>Bachelor of Education in Foundation Phase Teaching</strong> and I am currently pursuing a <strong>Diploma in Software Engineering at WeThinkCode_</strong>.</p>
    
        <p>My coding journey started with pure curiosity. I taught myself <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, turning my love for problem-solving into a growing skillset. As an educator, I even introduced students to **coding and robotics** using free resources I could find, proving that tech education should be accessible to all.</p>
    
        <p>Beyond coding and teaching, Iâ€™m a **social and creative person** I love long walks on the beach and getting lost in a good book.</p>

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>This is a simple, but visually appealing website that showcases my love for chocolate. Built using only HTML and CSS, it has fun facts, my favorite types of chocolate, and the sweet indulgence of savoring this scrumptious treat. 
                It's a tasty journey into the world of chocolate! </p>
